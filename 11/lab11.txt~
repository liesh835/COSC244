1) The purpose of send() is to print the given line of inoput to the output stream
2) Goes to the socket's output stream
3) The toString() method allows for the id to be printed whenever an object of the ClientHandler class is sent to
a print function
4) The client number is not recycled as count is constantly incremented and added to the id variable whenever a new
client connects to the server. The id is never adjusted or decremented to care for this.
5) Line 13, the Line 20 - 24
6) 10 Threads
7) Main thread starts the server that constantly listens for new connections
3 ClientHandler threads are created that send a welcoming message, then reads input and performs sendAll()
(6) The 3 ClientHandler threads create 2 threads each, one for reading input (InputStreamReader) and sends it to the
socket, and the other for receiving output from the socket (PrintWriter) and writes it to stdout.
